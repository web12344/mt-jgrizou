## This interface can read your mind

## Introduction

Below is a typical user interface. It is a code-entering device. To enter a code:  
- Look at the digit you want to type.  
- If it is yellow, click on the yellow button.  
- If it is grey, click on the grey button.  

The machine will then find out the digit you have in mind by elimination.

With two big coloured buttons, this interface is designed to remove most user choices and channel you to behave in one standardized way. The aim is normative: it is more efficient and convenient for the designers if we all behave the same way, and it is also easier to predict your future actions. Think of apps like Instagram or Twitter—designers have done a great job at funneling our interaction there.

But let me show you another way to interact with digital devices.

Below is the same interface, but the buttons have no predefined colours. You get to decide the buttons’ colour in your mind, and the machine adapts to your preferences on the fly.

## Examples of User Choices

Here are examples of how different users interact with the same interface:

| ![User 1 choice](https://jgrizou.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/demo_3x3_fullpad_1.gif) | ![User 2 choice](https://jgrizou.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/demo_3x3_fullpad_2.gif) | ![User 3 choice](https://jgrizou.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/demo_3x3_fullpad_3.gif) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| User 1 choice | User 2 choice | User 3 choice |

Notice how once revealed, the colour patterns on buttons are different for each user. This reflects their personal preferences. Each user typed in the same digit but used the buttons differently to do so. Yet the machine was able to adapt, finding both what the user wanted to do (enter the digit) and how they were trying to do it. I call these self-calibrating interfaces because they adapt to your preferences while you are using them.
