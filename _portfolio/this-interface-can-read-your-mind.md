## This interface can read your mind  
*Last update: August 2019*  

*"A web-app to explain self-calibrating interfaces."*

## Introduction

Below is a typical user interface. It is a code-entering device.  
- Look at the digit you want to type.  
- If it is yellow, click the yellow button.  
- If it is grey, click the grey button.  

The machine will figure out the digit you have in mind by elimination.

With two big colored buttons, this interface is designed to remove most user choices and funnel you into standardized behavior. Designers use such approaches in apps like Instagram and Twitter to predict actions more easily.

But what if digital devices could adapt to your preferences? Below is the same interface, but the buttons have no predefined colors. You decide the buttons' colors in your mind, and the machine adapts on the fly.

## Examples of User Choices

| ![User 1](https://jgrizou.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/demo_3x3_fullpad_1.gif) | ![User 2](https://jgrizou.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/demo_3x3_fullpad_2.gif) | ![User 3](https://jgrizou.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/demo_3x3_fullpad_3.gif) |
|:---------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| User 1 choice                                 | User 2 choice                                 | User 3 choice                                 |

Notice how the color patterns on buttons differ for each user. This reflects personal preferences. The machine adapts, discovering both what users want to do (enter a digit) and how they do it. I call these *self-calibrating interfaces* because they adapt to preferences in real time.
